Abstract:
========
    This bashscript downloads a file from the ARD-Mediathek (see
    http://www.ard-mediathek.de). This site contains most of the movies and
    shows which were broadcasted within the last seven days on the German tv
    station "ARD". 
    The script automatically selects the highest available quality for download,
    so if available it fetches the HD version. It also converts the downloaded
    files from the original Flash Video format to a more appropriate MKV or MP4
    format.

Usage:
======
    ./ard [URL]
    Where [URL] is a url from the ard-mediathek linking to a movie. It can be
    recognized by a 'documentId' in its parameters.

Requirements:
============
    - rtmpdump (Ubuntu-Package 'rtmpdump')
    - curl (Ubuntu-Package 'curl')
    - ffmpeg (Ubuntu-Package 'ffmpeg')

Configuration:
=============
    The first two variables in the script can be used to configure its
    behaviour:
        - 'targetdir': The directory where the script should place the
          downloaded files. This directory must exist and must be writeable.
        - 'targettype': The filetype of the downloaded file. The file is
          converted on the fly while downloading to this format. Tested values
          are: 'mkv' and 'mp4'.
